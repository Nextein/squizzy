I want to create the best team possible given the following information:

If each monster has the stats given in aggregated_stats.json.
Better stats make a better team.
A team that can defeat any other team is optimal.
Having several monsters in a team of the same type gives them affinity boosts according to the stats mentioned in affinities.json. This boost is only received when 3, 5 or 7 of the same affinity appear in the same team.
Teams can have a maximum of 8 monsters.
I must have these monsters in my collection, which is provided further below.
The team cannot cost more than 500 coins in total.

Monsters cost different amounts of coin based on their stage and tier as follows:

Tier 5. Stage 1: 50 coins.
Tier 5. Stage 2: 70 coins.
Tier 5. Stage 3: 90 coins.
Tier 4. Stage 1: 50 coins.
Tier 4. Stage 2: 65 coins.
Tier 4. Stage 3: 90 coins.
Tier 3. Stage 1: 50 coins.
Tier 3. Stage 2: 50 coins.
Tier 3. Stage 3: 75 coins.
All else: 60 coins.

Create multiple options of the best teams that meet this criteria and explain why they are optimal.

My collection is formed of the following monsters:
